Goals: 

- Configure the stages of the payment process. Things to configure include: 

	- The payment steps
	- The fees: 
		- Platform fee: configured by TSM (in orgs.json)
		- Payment gateway fee (fixed + % of the total), configured by the organization (in payment config).



Payments config UI: 

- Will render the configuration object. 
- Needs a save button on the bottom. 
- Also needs to have the toption to copy existing config from other locations (namely, organization, tournament or team. Selecting this source can be tricky... probably a list of all the configurations already existing in the DB)

- Platform comissions: this is set by TSM, so it should not go into the payments config object. 
    - Should be a different object, probably configured in a different place. 
	  But it has to go to the client, together with the steps config. 
    - It can be on the orgs.json file, and the relevant section copied to the payment config 
	  everytime it is requested. 

- The Payments config object has some data in the top level and a payment steps definition. 
    - Top level platform fees (applied to every purchase)
	- Organization fees (applied to every purchase)
	- (currency?)

- The payment steps structure is defined already in the player app. There is a sample object there (at least in the repository). 
	- Add / Edit / Delete Step: name, description
		- Add / Edit / Delete Option: name, description, value

- Use the same approach as the stages and groups: a hierarchy with dialogs to edit. 



Additions: 

- TSM Config: platform fee definition: % + fixed value. 
	- Displayed in every payment (to the user), added at the end.
